# Predicting-Concrete-Strength-with-Neural-Networks
This repository provides an R-based neural network model to predict concrete compressive strength. Leveraging the neuralnet package, it covers data normalization, model training with various hidden layers, and performance evaluation using correlation analysis. Ideal for those interested in predictive modeling in material science.
